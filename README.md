# Binary Array Flipping (C++) â€“ Minimum K-Bit Flips

This project solves a common algorithm problem: finding the **minimum number of K-bit flips** needed to convert a binary array (of 0s and 1s) into all 1s.  
If it's impossible, the program returns `-1`.

## ðŸ§ª Problem Summary
Given:
- An array of `n` binary digits (0 or 1)
- A flipping window size `k`

At each step, you can flip **k consecutive bits** (i.e., turn `0` to `1` and `1` to `0`).  
The goal is to convert the entire array to all 1s using the **minimum number of flips**.
